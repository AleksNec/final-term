                <h2>Course Description</h2>
                <p>This hands-on course follows on from COMP 1850 Applied Web Development Level 1. Students who already
                    understand HTML and CSS will explore web development in more depth with new topics and techniques.
                    Participants will gain a deeper understanding of the latest technologies including HTML5 and CSS3
                    for
                    developing web sites and applications. There is a focus on responsive design and mobile presentation
                    through
                    the use of Media Queries. Adding behavior to web sites using JavaScript frameworks such as jQuery is
                    introduced. </p>
                <p>Labs and exercises focus on industry standard web development methodology. Students gain
                    experience creating templates for content management systems and presentation. Additional topics
                    will
                    include: leveraging Server Side Includes (SSI) for re-usable code, source control for managing your
                    code,
                    and web-based fonts for professional typography. COMP 1950 is a required course for the BCIT
                    Computing
                    Advanced Web Technologies associate certificates in Applied Web Development, AWD and Web and Mobile
                    Application Development, WMA, as well as an elective in the CST Diploma. </p>
                <p> COMP 1950 and COMP 2015 are
                    also
                    the prerequisites for COMP 2052 Android and Mobile Application Development Tools. By the end of this
                    course
                    successful students will be able to build dynamic and semantically marked-up content providing
                    Search
                    Engine
                    Optimized (SEO) pages.</p>
